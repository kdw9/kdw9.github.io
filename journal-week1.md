Over the past few weeks at the Iron Yard, I’ve learned quite a bit of valuable information regarding the basic functions and use of mobile apps.  Besides formulating a structure of code to produce a target vision, I have now seen the importance of thinking outside the box to get to the core of whom the app is intended for and how those individuals will eventually use it. The user experience is one of the most significant assets implemented when creative a very strong and efficient app.

Computer science is a very unique and elaborated field. It can easily sway your attention into writing code from a linear point of view.  From dealing with unforeseen errors to bugs, the process can be somewhat tedious. However, keeping and open mind to specific tasks the users would like to preform while using the app is very beneficial in how the structure of your code should be. The codes an iOS developer writes could be so sophisticated and savvy, but it if has no value to the user by it being too complicated then it serves as a loss in the grand scheme of things.

The impact of the user will be at the forefront of my apps because I believe that people in general value their time. We are living in a microwavable ready-made era, where patience is no longer a virtue, its facing extinction. With attentions spans being reduce to seconds, opportunities to push through a short window grasping the users and getting them involved in the functionality of the product is a challenge by itself. It’s always better to measure twice and cut once; at the end of the day, first impressions are usually the ones that last. 

The users-focus should be a well thought out process that will go along with my coding based on research of what the interests are of the demographic groups I am targeting.  An easy to use approach would be the foundation of which my apps are built on. My audience must find the app memorable but to the point all in one instance. These individuals are potentially my clients, and in order to keep the revolving door of business open, tending to their needs is vital in the overall structure and development of my apps.
